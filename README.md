# APIforInteractionNetworks

These files are used to create interaction networks between different node types including genes, CpG sites/islands, compound and diseases.
For the different nodes, different APIs can be used to extract information from online databases.

The python notebook can be used as a template to construct a genomic interactio network. Visualization of the network is possible with igraph althrough 
it is recommended to use a more advanced network visualization tool.
